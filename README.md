# Example Rush Monorepo

This template is part of the documentation of the [Rush](https://rushjs.io/) tool.
It contains documented templates for all the standard Rush configuration files.
It also includes three barebones projects that illustrate some dependency
relationships in a Rush repo:

- **apps/my-app**: The web application
- **libraries/my-controls**: A control library used by the application
- **tools/my-toolchain**: A NodeJS build tool used to compile the other projects

(These projects are NOT meant to provide a realistic toolchain.)


# Building this repo

To build the projects in this repo, try these shell commands:

```
npm install -g @microsoft/rush
rush install
rush build
```

For more information, see the documentation at:  https://rushjs.io/

# Adding in Next.Js app
1. `cd apps && pnpm create next-app`
2. `cd ../../ && rush install` You don't have to cd back to the top level to run any rush command but I did to just make sure I knew where I was.
3. I got the error `The shrinkwrap file is out of date. You need to run "rush update".` so my next step was `rush update`
4. I got the error `ERRORâ€‰ eslint-config-next > @typescript-eslint/parser > @typescript-eslint/typescript-estree: tsutils@3.21.0 requires a peer of typescript@>=2.8.0 || >= 3.2.0-dev || >= 3.3.0-dev || >= 3.4.0-dev || >= 3.5.0-dev || >= 3.6.0-dev || >= 3.6.0-beta || >= 3.7.0-dev || >= 3.7.0-beta but none was installed` so then I did `cd apps/next-app && pnpm install typescript && cd ../../ && rush update`
5. `rush build` or `rush build --to next-app` to specifically run the next-app created
